        <p>
            You can use free-form searching to find parts based upon a part’s part number, synopsis,
            primary manufacturer’s name or primary manufacturer’s part number (MPN). Terms that
            represents these elements may be mixed and matched in your search expression.
        </p>

        <h2>Searching by Part Number</h2>
        <p>
            If you enter a part number as a search term then to be recognized as a part number, it
            must at least include the part class number and the item number. It may optionally include
            the number item variation.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, both <b>102-00033-04</b> and <b>102-000033</b> are valid part number search terms. This
            example assumes that your organization uses 5 digits for its item number.
        </p>

        <h2>Searching Free-form</h2>
        <p>
            When entering a free-form search expression, the special characters that are used by {{ APP_NAME }}
            to display units of measure need to be represented as standard text characters in your search term:
        </p>

        <ul class="browser-default">
            <li>&Omega; is represented as Ohms or ohms</li>
            <li>&#181; is represented as U or u</li>
            <li>&#8451; is represented as C or c</li>
            <li>&#8457; is represented as F or f</li>
            <li>&#8491; is represented A or a</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h2>Part Class Filtering</h2>
        <p>
            You can narrow your search to a specific class of parts by first selecting a part class.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, to search for all capacitors whose capacitance is 10&#181;F, you would first select
            the capacitor part class, then enter <b>10uF</b> as the search term.
        </p>

        <p>
            Matches will be made against partial words as well, for example <b>yel</b> will match all parts that
            contain the word “yellow” or “Yellow” or “yell” and so-on.
        </p>

        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h2>Searching With Multiple Terms</h2>
        <p>
            If your search expression is composed of multiple terms, then each search term is OR’ed,
            meaning that the search results will list all of the parts that match at least one of the
            terms of your search expression.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, if your search term is <b>270Ohms 5% 0805</b> then your search will list all parts
            that contain “270&Omega; ” or the “5%” or “0805”.
        </p>

        <p>
            White space, comprised of any number of spaces or tabs, separates your search terms. If
            you have a term that is composed of multiple words and you want these words to be treated as
            a single term then they should be put in quotes, for example <b>“Big Company Inc.”</b> will be treated
            as single term whereas <b>Big Company Inc.</b> will be treated as three separate terms.
        </p>

        <p>
            Given how white space is interpreted, you should not have whitespace between a value and
            the associated units of measure. In other words, want to search for parts that contain “10V”,
            then your search term should be <b>10V</b> or <b>“10V”</b> as opposed to 10 V. If you
            type <b>10 V</b> then the <b>10</b> and the <b>V</b> will be treated as separate search terms
            and the search will match all parts that contain “10” and “V”, which is probably not what you want!
        </p>
