This file is intended to be used as a Django include file for the purpose of displaying
the nothing-to-see-here message:

    {% include 'bom/nothing-to-see.html' required_privilege=PPP %}
 
 where UUU is the includee's user profile variable for the currently logged-in user and PPP 
 is a string that denotes the role that user must have in order to gain access.

{% endcomment %}


<p>Nothing to see here ðŸ™ˆ because you do not have {{ required_privilege }} privileges. Please contact {{ organization }}'s {{ APP_NAME }} owner 
<a href="mailto:{{ profile.organization.owner.email }}">{{ profile.organization.owner.email }}</a> for assistance</p>
